  abstract = {Ice ablation is related to air temperature by the positive degree-day factor. Variations of the positive degree-day factor in West Greenland are studied using an energy-balance model to simulate ablation under different conditions. Degree-day factors for simulated and measured ice ablation at Nordbogletscher and Qamanârssûp sermia agree well with values around 8 mm d−1 °C−1. Degree-day factors for snow are less than half those for ice. Energy-balance modelling shows that degree-day factors vary with summer mean temperature, surface albedo and turbulence but there is only evidence of large positive degree-day factors at lower temperatures and with low albedo (0.3). The greatest effect of albedo variations (0.3–0.7) is at lower temperatures while variations in turbulence have greater effect at higher temperatures. Current models may underestimate runoff from the Greenland ice sheet by several tenths because they use a degree-day factor for melting ice that is too small for the colder parts of the ice sheet, i.e. the upper ablation area and the northerly margin.}

  abstract = {In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the possibility of a machine learning model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for seasonal prediction of the temperature of Dhaka city. Prior knowledge of temperature is essential, especially in tropical regions like Dhaka, as it aids in forecasting heatwaves and implementing effective preparedness schemes. While various machine learning models have been employed for the prediction of hot weather across the world, research specially focused on Bangladesh is limited. Additionally, the application of machine learning models needs to be curated to suit the particular weather features of any region. Therefore, this study approaches ANN method for prediction of the temperature of Dhaka exploring the underlying role of related weather variables. Using the daily data for the months of February to July collected from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data (0.25°~×~0.25° global grid) for the years 2011–2020, this study focuses on finding the combination of weather variables in predicting temperatures. The densely populated city, Dhaka, has faced severe consequences due to extreme climate conditions in recent years, and this study will pave a new dimension for further research regarding the topic.},

They were chosen as examples of a simple one-layer snow model and a more detailed multiple-layer snow model (SNTHERM). The snow models were combined with the same one-dimensional model for the heat and water balance of the underlying soil (CoupModel). Data from an arable field in central Sweden (Marsta), covering two years (1997–1999) of soil temperature, snow depth and eddy-correlation measurements were successfully compared with the models. Conditions with a snow pack deeper or shallower than 10\,cm and bare soil resulted in similar discrepancies. The simulated net radiation and sensible heat flux were in good agreement with that measured during snow-covered periods, except for situations with snowmelt when the downward sensible heat flux was overestimated by 10–20\,Wm−2. The results showed that the uncertainties in parameter values were more important than the model formulation and that both models were useful in evaluating the limitations and uncertainties of the measurements.}

  abstract = {Hourly melt and discharge of Storglaciären, a small glacier in Sweden, were computed for two melt seasons, applying temperature-index methods to a 30 m resolution grid for the melt component. The classical degree-day method yielded a good simulation of the seasonal patient of discharge, but the pronounced melt-induced daily discharge cycles were not captured. Modelled degree-day factors calculated for every hour and each gridcell from melt obtained from a distributed energy-balance model varied substantially, both diurnally and spatially. A new distributed temperature-index model is suggested, attempting to capture both the pronounced diurnal melt cycles and the spatial variations in melt due to the effects of surrounding topography. This is accomplished by including a radiation index in terms of potential clear-sky direct solar radiation, and thus, without the need for other data besides air temperature. This approach improved considerably the simulation of diurnal discharge fluctuations and yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of melt rates. The incorporation of measured global radiation to account for the reduction in direct solar radiation due to cloudiness did not lead to additional improvement in model performance.}

Moreover, we propose Transductive LSTM (T-LSTM) which exploits the local information in time-series prediction. In transductive learning, the samples in the test point vicinity are considered to have higher impact on fitting the model. In this study, a quadratic cost function is considered for the regression problem. Localizing the objective function is done by considering a weighted quadratic cost function at which point the samples in the neighborhood of the test point have larger weights. We investigate two weighting schemes based on the cosine similarity between the training samples and the test point. In order to assess the performance of the proposed method in different weather conditions, the experiments are conducted on two different time periods of a year. The results show that T-LSTM results in better performance in the prediction task.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is quickly expanding in water management. Additionally, the artificial neural network methodology has an advantage over traditional statistical approaches in that it does not need assumptions about the distribution of data and variables. These methods can be used if there is a large enough data collection and criteria relevant to the nature of the problem. Preprocessing data before utilizing it improves the performance of the AI model. Evaporation matters in water management, agriculture processes and soil science. It is critical to ensure proper estimation of evaporation losses for effective water resource planning and management particularly in drought-prone areas such as Adana. Artificial intelligence approaches can be applied successfully in evaporation calculation. In this research, we used the Standard scaler, power transformer, robust scaler quantile transformer (Uniform) and quantile transformer (Normal), and min-max scaler preprocessing techniques to preprocess the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). We also trained the MLPNN using unprocessed data and compared it to the results of the preprocessed model. In the setup of the model, daily temperature, pressure, wind, sunny hours, and humidity parameters covering the years 2018-2021 were presented as input to the MLPNN model. Consequently, we pinpoint that all preprocessing approaches produce better outcomes than unscaled. Although all models produced statistically high accuracy predictions according to statistical criteria, the MLPNN model established without transformation (test phase: r\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;: 0.93, NSE : 0.927, SMAPE: 10.77, RMSE: 1.2, MAE: 0.9) exhibited the lowest accuracy. The evaporation prediction model that was developed using the MLPNN-based standard scalar optimization algorithm exhibited the highest level of accuracy~ (test phase: r\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;: 0.978, NSE: 0.977, SMAPE: 5.93, RMSE: 0.68, MAE: 0.48).

It can be concluded from these results that the estimation of meteorological variables requires the scaling and presentation of data in a uniform structure. Therefore, improving efficiency and productivity in water management or agricultural processes can be enhanced by making more accurate evaporation estimates.\&lt;/p\&gt;}

  abstract = {The development of the seasonal snow cover is entirely driven by atmospheric forcing. SNOWPACK uses measured snow depths to determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent heat flux parameterizations are derived from Monin–Obukhov similarity and include a formulation for wind pumping. The formulations will also adapt to drifting snow conditions. The new suggestion is consistent with the observation of different roughness lengths for scalars and momentum over snow. An accurate formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface hoar, a very important weak layer. We also account for the effect of wind pumping on the thermal conductivity in the uppermost snow layers. The surface energy and mass exchange formulations are evaluated by looking at the formation of the important thin layers surface hoar and melt–freeze crusts in SNOWPACK. Those layers are well simulated. In addition, the complete snow profile development is modeled successfully for the parameters grain type, temperature, density, grain size and liquid water content. An overall score between 0 and 1 is used to describe the profile agreement with observations and an average score of over 0.8 is reached.},

This paper investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of snow depth across the Qinghai Plateau (QP) during 1980?2018 based on passive microwave (PMW) satellite observation and reanalysis products. The study identified the relationships between the changes in PMW snow depth and topographic features and revealed the impact of climatic variables (air temperature, precipitation and wind speed) and large-scale atmospheric circulations on observed snow depth variability. The results show that the spatial pattern of snow depth climatology is similar in all datasets, except in terms of magnitude, with high values in the southern and southeastern parts of the QP and low values in the eastern and northwestern parts. Average snow depth correlates positively with precipitation, elevation and slope, and negatively with air temperature and wind speed. The long-term trends in snow depth vary with the season and the datasets. The PMW snow depth across the QP shows a significant annual (?0.125?cm·decades?1, p?},

  abstract = {Surface albedo (ALB), snow cover fraction (SCF) and snow water equivalent (SWE) of state-of-the-art coupled climate models are compared and validated against ground-based and remote-sensed climatologies. Most IPCC AR4 climate models predict excessive snow mass in spring and suffer from a delayed spring snow melt while the onset of the snow accumulation is generally well captured. This positive SWE bias is mainly caused by too heavy snowfall during the winter and spring season. Seasonal cycles of snow cover area (SCA) at continental scales are captured reasonably well by most participating models. Two models clearly overestimate SCA over both Eurasia and North America. Year-to-year variations are reasonably well captured over both Eurasia and North America in winter and spring. The most pronounced underestimation in the interannual SCA variability is generally simulated during snow melt. The pronounced negative SCA trend that has been observed from 1979 to 2000 is only partly reproduced in the AR4 model simulations. Furthermore, the computed trends show a large spread among the models. Results from time slice simulations with the ECHAM5 climate model suggest that accurate sea surface temperatures are vital for correctly predicting SCA trends. Simulated global mean annual surface albedos are slightly above the remote-sensed surface albedo estimates. The participating AR4 models generally reproduce the seasonal cycle of the surface albedo with sufficient accuracy while systematic albedo biases are predicted over both snow-free and snow-covered areas, with the latter being distinctly more pronounced. The study shows that the surface albedo over snow-covered forests is probably too high in various state-of-the-art global climate models. The analysis demonstrates that positive biases in SCA are not necessarily related to positive albedo biases. Furthermore, an overestimation of area-averaged SWEs is not necessarily related to positive SCA anomalies since the relationship between SWE and SCF is highly nonlinear.},

  abstract = {Phenomena such as cloudiness, atmospheric aerosol or sensor failure cause missing data (gaps) in remote sensing images and damage spatial and temporal continuity. Dealing with this deficiency is of importance for continuous spatio-temporal modeling and environmental studies. Simplicity, efficiency and accuracy are dominant factors in practicality of gap filling algorithms especially in dealing with large gaps and long time series. In this study, an effective and efficient spatio-temporal gap filling algorithm is proposed, implemented and tested. The method was applied to MODIS 8-day Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET) datasets with a 1~km spatial resolution. To assess the performance of the proposed methods, artificial gaps were introduced and filled. Then estimated and real values were compared. The results showed that our method can predict the missing values very accurately (based on RMSE) even in gaps with heterogeneous surface for both variables. Our proposed method has no limitation on the shape and size of the gaps. The proposed algorithm is flexible regarding parameterization. It can handle large volumes of datasets due to its parallelizable structure. More importantly, the method run-time is extremely low even in large gaps.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}

  abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.}
